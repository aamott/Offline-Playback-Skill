Play local music files using Mycroft

## About
This is a basic Mycroft skill allowing playback of local music.

## Examples
* "Search offline for Beethoven"
* "Play something by Bach"
* "Play the album Old Hits offline"
* "Play my liked songs"

### Playing music:

* "Play something by Coventant" - Will queue songs by Coventant
* "Play Background" - Will play either your playlist named "Background" or the first song result
* "Search locally for Hello Nasty" - Will play first song result matching the query

### Controls:
* "Play the next/previous song" - Will skip the track either forward or backwards, respectively
* "Stop/Pause the music" - Will pause the current track
