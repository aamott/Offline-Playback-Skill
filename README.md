Plays music in the local music directory

## About
This skill allows playback of music from a local folder. You can place files in the ~/Music folder.  
Note: all playback will be run in the background. Functional without a GUI.  
Forked from @forslund's Spotify skill. 

## Examples
* "Search offline for Beethoven"
* "Play something by Bach"
* "Play the album Old Hits offline"
* "Play my liked songs"
* "Play the next/previous song"
* "Stop/Pause the music"

## TODO
Implement a better song database manager (that doesn't have to scan the whole music directory every startup)  
Detect and scan USB Drive insert
